## What is a Welding PQR and Why is it Important?

The Welding Procedure Qualification Record, or PQR, is a **record of a test weld** performed using a specific welding procedure. It documents the actual welding parameters used and the results of any testing performed on the weld. This data is essential for:

*   **Ensuring weld quality and integrity**: The PQR proves that a specific welding procedure can produce acceptable welds.
*   **Compliance with industry standards**: Many codes and standards (e.g., ASME, AWS) require qualified welding procedures.
*   **Providing a reference for future welding operations**: Welders can use the PQR as a guide for setting up their equipment and performing the weld.
