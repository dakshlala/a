## Understanding Eyebrow Extensions

**Eyebrow extensions** provide a semi-permanent solution to enhance your natural brows. They involve attaching individual synthetic or real hair fibers to existing brow hairs or directly onto the skin. This creates a fuller, more defined look, perfect for those with over-plucked or naturally thin eyebrows.

**Benefits of Eyebrow Extensions:**

*   **Instant Results:** See a noticeable difference immediately after application.
*   **Customizable:** Choose the shape, color, and thickness that best suits your face.
*   **Non-Invasive:** A safer alternative to permanent makeup procedures like microblading.
